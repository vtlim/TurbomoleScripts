# TurbomoleScripts
## OutputParsing
All scripts that can be used for analyzing the output of a Turbomole 
calculation from a release version of Turbomole. 
Run [scriptname] -h on any script for description and usage information. 

Summary of scripts:
- backUp:        A Bash script that backs up files from local and remote 
                 hosts. Makes an extra timestamped version of a backed up
                 file any time the file changes. 
- get_rot_const: Returns the rotational constants for the molecule 
                 specified within a Turbomole format coord file. 
- xyz2cub:       Converts a Turbomole format xyz file to a cube file. A
                 Turbomole format xyz file is NOT a coordinate file. It
                 holds property values on a grid.
